The program will execute a sequence of three tests, in order to check that everything is functionining correctly.
The test run depends of the value set by the pos (or scale) option. Only one test at a time. The program exits with status 0 after the test has been run regardless of outcome (since some tests will require manual checking).

Valid tests:
samsung     Tests to ensure you can read and write to the POS when it is using
            the SamsungESP scale internally. Does not need an actual scale
            hooked up.

            Launch the POS then run the command with 
            --test --pos=samsung --pos-serial=/your/serial/port 
            Then added a weighed item in the POS. Repeat three times
            It will perform three tests.
            Returning a weight of 5 kg,returning a fractional weight (5.652 kg) 
            and a random weight. Observe results by reading the command output
            and checking for errors in the POS.
